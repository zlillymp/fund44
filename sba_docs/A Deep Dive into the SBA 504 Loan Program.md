> # A Deep Dive into the SBA 504 Loan Program

The SBA 504 Loan Program offers a powerful financing tool for small businesses seeking to invest in major fixed assets. It provides long-term, fixed-rate financing for projects that promote business growth and job creation. Unlike the more versatile 7(a) program, the 504 loan is specifically designed for purchasing assets like commercial real estate and heavy machinery. The program is delivered through a unique partnership between a conventional lender, a Certified Development Company (CDC), and the small business owner, making large-scale projects more accessible [1].

## The 504 Loan Structure: A Three-Way Partnership

The most distinctive feature of the SBA 504 loan is its structure, which typically divides the project cost among three parties:

*   **A private-sector lender** (such as a bank or credit union) provides 50% of the total project cost. This loan is the senior mortgage with its own terms and conditions.
*   **A Certified Development Company (CDC)**, which is a nonprofit organization certified by the SBA to promote local economic development, provides up to 40% of the cost. This portion is backed by a 100% SBA-guaranteed debenture.
*   **The small business owner** contributes a down payment of at least 10% of the project cost [2].

This structure benefits the business by requiring a lower down payment than most conventional loans and providing a long-term, fixed interest rate on the CDC portion of the loan, which offers stability and predictable payments.

### Use of Proceeds

SBA 504 loan funds are earmarked for specific types of fixed-asset projects. The primary goal is to help businesses acquire, construct, or improve long-term assets. Acceptable uses include:

*   Purchasing existing buildings or land.
*   Constructing new facilities or modernizing existing ones.
*   Acquiring long-term machinery and equipment with a useful life of at least 10 years.
*   Improving land, streets, utilities, and parking lots [1].

It is important to note that 504 loans **cannot** be used for working capital, inventory, consolidating debt (unless it is part of a larger real estate acquisition project), or investing in rental real estate [1].

### Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for a 504 loan, a business must meet specific criteria related to its financial standing and public policy goals. The key requirements are:

*   **For-Profit Status:** The business must be a for-profit entity operating in the U.S.
*   **Net Worth:** It must have a tangible net worth of less than $20 million.
*   **Net Income:** It must have an average net income of less than $6.5 million after federal income taxes for the two years preceding the application.
*   **Job Creation/Public Policy:** The project must meet a job creation or other public policy goal. Typically, this means creating or retaining one job for every $75,000 of the SBA loan portion, though alternative goals related to community development, energy efficiency, or aiding specific types of businesses can also qualify [1].

## Loan Terms, Rates, and Fees

The 504 program offers attractive, long-term financing conditions that are often more favorable than what is available through conventional channels.

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Maximum Loan Amount** | Generally up to $5 million for the CDC/SBA portion, with certain public policy projects eligible for up to $5.5 million [1]. |
| **Maturity Terms** | 10, 20, or 25-year terms are available for the CDC/SBA portion of the loan [1]. |
| **Interest Rates** | The CDC/SBA portion has a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan, pegged to an increment above the current market rate for 10-year U.S. Treasury issues. The private lender's loan will have its own separate rate and terms [1]. |
| **Down Payment** | A minimum of 10% is required from the borrower. This increases to 15% for new businesses (less than two years old) or for single-purpose properties (e.g., hotels, gas stations), and to 20% if both conditions apply [2]. |
| **Fees** | Fees on the CDC/SBA portion total approximately 3% of the debenture amount and can often be financed with the loan [1]. |

## The Role of Certified Development Companies (CDCs)

CDCs are the exclusive providers of the SBA 504 loan program. These nonprofit organizations are certified and regulated by the SBA to work with lenders and small businesses in their communities. Their role is to package the SBA loan, submit it for approval, and then service the loan throughout its term. They are experts in the 504 program and are the primary point of contact for any business interested in this financing option [1].

## How to Apply

The first step in the application process is to find and contact a local CDC. The SBA provides a directory of authorized CDCs on its website. The CDC will assess the project's eligibility, help the business prepare its application, and work with a private lender to secure the senior loan portion of the financing package [1].
